# Drako - Unofficial Ghidra Kotlin Integration Attempt

`Drako` is an attempt to encourage people to integrate Kotlin language into the `Ghidra` project. And also, encourage for
experimenting any features they want onto the `Ghidra` project.

`Ghidra` is a very large project with seemly historical code, it will be good to just experiment anything we want without
any worries.

# Current Status

Very early attempts.

I converted the `JavaScriptProvider.java` into Kotlin using `IntelliJ Idea`, currently compiling well.

The rule of thumb is to refactor the code that is needed into Kotlin, but not all of them. The attempt is to leave the
original files as it were (except the one that is already converted), but use Kotlin on new files.
